        <h1>Eli's Recipes: Delicious Fusion of Southern and Classic American Flavors</h1>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Eli and you are on my first ever self-created website. I hope you enjoy your stay and find somehthing scrumptious to try in your own home kitchen.</p>
        <h2>Why I made this website</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a web developer! Through this webpage, I hope to prove my skills in HTML and CSS to the world and share some great recipes in the process. Who doesn't love a bit of food with a side of code?<p>
