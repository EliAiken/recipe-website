        <h1>Eli's Recipes: Delicious Fusion of Ecuadorian and Classic American Flavors</h1>
        <p>Welcome! My name is Eli and you are on my first ever self-created website. Enjoy your stay and find something scrumptious to try in your own home kitchen.</p>
        <h2>Why I made this website</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a web developer! Through this webpage, I hope to prove my introductory skills in HTML and CSS and share some great recipes in the process. Who doesn't love a bit of food with a side of code?<p>
