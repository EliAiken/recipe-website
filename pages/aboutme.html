        <h1>Who is Eli?</h1>
        <p>I am a 27-year-old, aspiring self-taught web developer with absolutely no prior knowledge of this field. I first got interested in coding in 2022 due to my love for computer hardware and playing video games on my self-built PCs. I have always been interested in computers but coding seemed too daunting an endeavor. After much online research to know how I could get my feet wet, I found the Odin Project which has helped guide me on my path to developing my skillset. I hope you enjoy the website!</p>
