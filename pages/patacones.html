        <h1>Patacones: A Humble, Yet Incredible Comfort Food</h1>
        <img class="extra img" src="../img/patacones.jpg" alt="A plate of yellow delicious and salted patacones">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Pronounced "Pah-tah-cone-ace," this fried manjar is a staple in the Ecuadorian costal region. They are so simple yet deceptively delicious, kinda like a basket of really good fries. Before you know it, you're picking up the last one cause you've just devoured them in 5 minutes flat... They are made with unripe plantains, cut into disk-like chunks and fried in hot oil, removed once, smashed flat into coins, and fried again to crisp them. Salt them up good before serving piping hot. They are reminiscent of a french fry, but have much more of a buttery-starchy flavor instead of a potato-y flavor. Nevertheless, incredibly delectable.</p>
        <p>These are also known in the carribean as "Tostones" and a similar dish "Tajadas" in some Central American countries. From what I've gathered from my various latin-american friends, Ecuador is the only country to use this name. These can be eaten with a wide variety of Ecuadorian costal dishes such as carne frita y arroz con menestra (pan-fried thin cut steaks with rice and beans), Ecuadorian parrillada (grilled meats, cook out style), huevo frito y arroz (fried eggs over rice), simply topped with cheese, and many others. Usually these are eaten as a side dish, but can be eaten en mass as a main focus by some families. Ecuadorian unripe plantain, commonly referred to as "verde" or <em>green</em> in Spanish, are extremely abundant and therefore cheap and easy to make. It is not uncommon for large families to go through 10 or more plantains in a single sitting, depending on how hungry they are.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Unripe Plantains (green, non-sweet smelling)</li>
                <li>1 Cup Vegetable Oil</li>
                <li>Salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 1 cup of vegetable oil into a small, shallow frying pan on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Peel plantains with knife, making a thin cut along the back edge of the peel and running down the length of the fruit. Use the knife point as a leaver to open the plantain little by little. (Note: the plantain in this state releases a staining gray liquid. Be careful with clothing.)</li>
                <li>Cut plantains into small, half-inch to 1-inch chunks. They should resemble cylinders. (Note: if you prefer bigger Patacones, cut pieces larger; they will flatten out into wider disks during the smashing process.</li>
                <li>Place plantain chunks into the oil one-side down. Flip after approximately 3 minutes of cooking or until cooked sides appear golden and develop reddish-brown vein-like structures.</li>
                <li>Once both sides are golden and veins appear, place into a paper towel-lined bowl.</li>
                <li>Prepare a cutting board as a smashing station. Place a plantain face up onto the cutting board and use the same bowl to smash downard into about quarter-inch thick disks. Repeat for all plantains and place back into the oil.</li>
                <li>Fry quickly for about 2 minutes, or until tapping with a fork results in a tough resistance (they should not be soft on the outside at this point). Remove from oil into a bowl.</li>
                <li>Immediately salt to taste and serve.</li>
            </ol>
