        <h1>White Rice with a Twist</h1>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>White rice in Ecuador is not the same as the commonly made rice cooker version that is ubiquitous in the US. For this recipe, we will make this dish in a rice cooker, though the traditional way is to cook it on the stovetop in a pot. This version adds a key ingredient, oil, to bring out the flavor during cooking and prevent the grains from becoming too sticky. An extra bit of oil is added to the finished product and stirred in before serving. White rice is eaten with everything in Ecuador. It truly is the Ecuadorian staple food of the costal region. Many people that I've met will even eat it three meals a day; yes, that includes at breakfast time. My father-in-law (who is native Ecuadorian) claims that "a meal without rice is not food." Ecuadorians take this food very seriously!</p>
        <p>There really isn't much to this dish, but the extra few steps that Ecuadorians use to make their rice really helps it stand out from what you're probably accustomed to in the US. The <strong><em>unkept</em> "secret"</strong> as mentioned before is to add in some oil or achiote (vegetable oil infused with annato to make it red-orange colored) before cooking as well as a good portion of salt to taste. The water covering the rice needs to taste salty, but not like the ocean salty. It is up to the preference of the cook to decide how much and the quantity of rice you make will also play a factor. Generally you need to <em>feel</em> the flavor of salt in the water when you taste it before beginning to cook or it won't come out quite right. All in all, don't by shy with it - Ã©chale no mas!</p>
